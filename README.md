Notes:

We should only use raised surfaces to indicate they are interactable. We should use paper surfaces to create boundaries for scrollable content. Maybe use value to provide depth to the papers surfaces. So it appears to be further in.

Dividers would be beveled

Edges of Paper surfaces shouldn't be rounded unless all sides of the paper is visible. So surfaces that go to the edge should not be rounded.

Colored text or icons should have a halo affect to create the appearance of subsurface scattering.

We need to make a handle for popup windows. We can use ridges to signify to the user that they can drag the windows around. I think that the title would look good centered.

Boundaries can be signified with surfaces, or with ridges. These are just borders with a highlight and a shadow giving the appearance of a ridge.

We need to build Windows, Tabs, Sortable Tabs.

We need to trap tab to stay within a Window, This could be done by placing a hidden element in the window to catch the last tab and to refocus to the beginning hidden element. This will prevent unwanted tabbing to other windows.
